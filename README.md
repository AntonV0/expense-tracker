# Expense Tracker
## Project #55 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This project is a budgeting and expense tracking application built with React and Redux. Users can add their funds to 9 different categories (Housing, Food, Transportation, Utilities, Clothing, Healthcare, Personal, Education, and Entertainment). Users can also add multiple transactions in any category, which displays the transaction details and the remaining funds.

The aim of this project is to refactor the starter code using a slice-based approach to produce the app's actions and reducers. This was achieved with the Redux Toolkit.
## What I Learned
  - Importing the Redux Toolkit
  - Refactoring with the Redux Toolkit (simplifying the code and development)
  - Using the createSlice() function to automatically generate actions and reducers
